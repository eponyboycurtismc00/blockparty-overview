Social Recruiting leveraging blockchain offers the potential to match self taught learners with experts, to test and validate their skills so employers don’t need to. Think of it as crowdsourcing your candidate pool. A social recruiting platform startup (Asimov) could charge employers a highly competitive fee of a small percentage of their recruits first year wage. Portions of that fee can be shared amongst the experts that endorsed the recruit, giving their experts a strong incentive to provide high quality endorsements.

          <p class="lead">
The introduction and growth of blockchain applications has immense potential to impact and benefit population health, medical records, and patient-generated data.
<br> <br> Blockchain by nature is very secure an immutable. Security is a very common and serious concern when it comes to Patient Records. Having such an immutable architecture like blockhain provides, can potentially render all-payer claim databases (APCD) and Health Information Exchanges (HIE) obsolete. Trust verification through blockchain eliminates the need for a middle layer of verification or the use of a trust authority. The impact of this could be reduction in resources, time, and costs associated with verification, and perhaps a greater increase in the security of data.
<br> <br> According to Peter B. Nichol <i>(Peter B. Nichol is a healthcare business and technology executive, who has been recognized for digital innovation by CIO.com, the MIT Sloan School of Management, Computerworld and the Project Management Institute)</i>, through the use of blockchain, new shared medical records models have emerged. By providing trust where none exists, Blockchain will leap frog population health and allow for continuous access to patient records by directly linking information to clinical and financial outcomes. Population health just got smarter.
<br> <br> Counterfeit perscription drugs is another area of potential improvement through the use of blockchain. RFID, verification tags, and other mechanisms are being researched to potential communicate or cross reference with a blockchain backed paltform for legitimacy. 
<br> <br> Lastly, PGHD (Patient Generated Health Data) is another area with enormous potential. The promised value behind this data has not really been delivered upon yet. The main reason for this is based on ownership of data. When the owner of the data shifts back to the patient, it will enable a shift towards starting to capitalize on this information. As an example, Doctor visits, sleep patterns, heart rate, glucose, and other IoT devices can all be polled and then stored using the healthbank blockchain.

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Diamond Certification Example<span class="text-muted"></span></h2>
          <p class="lead">
Everledger has spent the past year developing a global, digital ledger that tracks and protects the world’s luxury goods. Using a cloud-based Blockchain solution helps protect against unauthorized access and tampering to meet the stringent security requirements of the diamond industry by fighting against insider threats, protecting data, and securing entry points and the integrity of network, all through the unique advanced security features underpinned by the cloud platform. 
<br><br>
Starting with the polished diamond industry, Everledger created relationships with the major diamond certification houses around the world to digitally encrypt over 1 million diamonds on the Blockchain. Now the company has extended  this technology to tackle the trade of rough diamonds certified through the UN-mandated Kimberley Process. An evolution of Everledger’s current system, the new platform will ensure the security and traceability of rough diamonds certified through the Kimberley Process, a 3-step verification system created in 2003 with 81 authorized countries to curb the sale of conflict stones. Fast forward thirteen years: 99% of the world’s diamonds are now from conflict-free zones, but critical problems remain in the industry including insurance fraud, the financing of global pipelines and the tampering of official certification.  
 <br><br>
Paper based processes continue to cripple the transparency and authenticity required when it comes to the trade of diamonds. Previously, a fraudulent Kimberley Process certificate was reported in a shipment of synthetic stones from Sierra Leone to Hong Kong, and the number of fraudulent insurance claims continues to grow, with no viable way for insurers to guarantee the authentic product has been lost or stolen. All of these problems impact the availability of diamond supply chain finance as banks and financiers remain hesitant to risk more capital where losses continue to rise.
 <br><br>
Building a system fueled by Blockchain’s core characteristics – immutability, security, speed and scalability – was Everledger’s first step towards ensuring the goods we’re trading and consuming are sourced by ethical means and can be traced throughout their lifetime journey.
